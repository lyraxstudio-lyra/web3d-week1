    <h3>My reasons for you to buy a Steam Deck are:</h3>
        <p>-With 512GB storage, installing multiple <span style="color: crimson">large games </span> like Hogwarts Legacy is managable, while for Switch, purchasing external SD cards will cause the total price higher than Steam Deck.</p>
        <p>-Steam <span style="color: crimson">publishes new games faster</span> than Nintendo; You can always find something to try out.</p>
        <p>-<span style="color: crimson">Playtime estimation</span>, in addition to showing the percentage of battery, it tells you the estimate battery life based on the game you are playing;</p>
        <p>-I managed to download Minecraft on Steam Deck, because Steam Deck works like a PC, on which you can find ways to <span style="color: crimson">install different games from different platform </span>;)</p>
        <p>-They provide extensive customer service without additional charge, with <span style="color: crimson">unlimited return policy</span>.</p>
        <p>-Steam as a platform is more <span style="color: crimson">friendly to independent game developer</span>(both platform cut around 30% from the revenue of indie games, however, Steam provides more freedom for indie developers).</p>

    <h3>My reason for you to buy a Steam Deck is that:</h3>
        <p>-The rate that the Steam publishing new games is faster than Nintendo; You can always find something to play.</p>
        <p>-It tells you the estimate time that the batteries can last for;</p>
        <p>-I managed to download Minecraft on it, I can help you if you also want to play portable Minecraft ;)</p>
